    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "I read the paper **“[Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)”** which provided a very clear understanding of image captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN-RNN network work architecture I chose involves the CNN (convolution neural network for vision) as the encoder and RNN (recurrent neural network for language generation) as the decoder. The CNN architecture uses transfer learning (resnet_50 pretrained network architecture) with batch normalization added, where convolution neural networks from the pretrained network are used to extract features from the COCO datasets images and encode them into compact representations for object/scene classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN architecture on the other hand decodes the features representation of the object/scene classifications passed from the CNN layer and uses the LSTM model with word embeddings to train to predict each word of the sentence after it has seen an image and generate sentences that corresponds to the images fed through the network.\t\n",
    "In selecting the variables for Task 1, not much as done to the CNN architecture since a pretrained model was used. Rather using fully connected layers at the end of the CNN architecture, rather a features layer was used instead to be passed to the RNN layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the RNN architecture, the following parameters were used in training the network: \n",
    "* batch_size = 64 \t\tfor each training batch\n",
    "* vocab_threshold = 6  \tas the minimum word count to generate the vocabulary size\n",
    "* vocab_from_file = True \tto load the vocabulary file\n",
    "* embed_size = 512 \tas the dimensionality of image and word embeddings\n",
    "* hidden_size = 512  \tas number of features in hidden state of the RNN decoder\n",
    "* num_epochs = 3             as the number of training epochs\n",
    "* save_every = 1             \tto save the training model weights in the log file\n",
    "* print_every = 500          \tprint to window screen the average loss of the trained model weight\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "I left the transform as it was provided because it is pretty standard and the same with what I had in mind to implement. This is because the transform_train method specified for the training datasets involves the following: first resizing the images all to the same size of 256, tten randomly crops an exact size out of each image (224x224x3), randomly flips the images horizontally, converts each image into a Torch Tensor and finally normalizes the images. These applied transforms in the images dataset pre-processing assists in prevent overfitting during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "In selecting the trainable parameters, the CNN architecture was simple as straight forward because i leveraged on resnet_50 pretrained model and just modified the fully connected layer from 1000 where it was used for image classification to a feature vector with batch normalization to prevent overfitting as the image embed layer to be fed to the RNN network architecture.\n",
    "For the RNN decoder architecture all the weights in the decoder were selected as trainable parameters including the batch normalization parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) + list(encoder.bn.parameters())```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "I chose the Adam optimizer (Adaptive Moment Estimation) because it is an adaptive learning rate algorithm method which computes the individual learning rates for each parameter from the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients. Also because of its advantage over stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which is maintaining a learning rate for each parameter (network weight) and adapts separately for each parameter during training as the learning rates unfold thereby converging faster. It is popular and widely used and also it gives me better results in comparison to SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
